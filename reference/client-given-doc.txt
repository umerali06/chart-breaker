Chart Breaker — Product Outline & Build Plan
Vision & Principles
Goal: A home‑health EHR + RCM platform that matches Alora’s core workflows, then surpasses it with safe, compliant AI.


Guardrails: HIPAA-first, audit‑ready, human‑in‑the‑loop on all AI suggestions, payer‑specific rules engines, and clear role‑based access control (RBAC).


North‑star outcomes: Faster, cleaner OASIS and visit notes, higher first‑pass claim rates, fewer denials, stronger documentation‑to‑billing alignment, and a trusted per‑patient chat experience.



Phase 1 — "Alora Parity" Foundation (MVP EHR)
Objective: Ship core, non‑AI EHR features so clinical operations can run end‑to‑end.
Patient & Episode Management


Referrals & intake (source, payer, auths).


Demographics, contacts, consents, primary language, caregiver support.


Episodes/periods of care, disciplines, frequency & duration, goals.


Assessments & Documentation


OASIS‑E SOC/ROC/Recert/Transfer/DC (structured forms, validations, lock & sign).


Discipline‑specific visit notes (SN, PT, OT, ST, MSW, HHA).


Care Plan (goals, interventions, problems), order management & MD signatures.


Document management: eFax, upload, OCR; standardized templates library.


Scheduling & Field Operations


Staff availability, recurring visits, route optimization (nice‑to‑have).


EVV (Electronic Visit Verification) hooks (GPS, clock‑in/out) for Medicaid.


Mobile clinician app (offline capture for notes, photos, vitals; later syncing).


Staff, Compliance & QA


Staff profiles, credentials, expirations, competencies; checklist tracking.


QA queue (pre‑billing documentation audits, deficiency tracking, lock rules).


Audit trail (who changed what, when) across charting and billing.


Billing & RCM (Baseline)


Payer table & fee schedules.


Medicare Home Health: NOA, PDGM/HIPPS grouping, LUPA checks, late‑submission flags.


Claims: 837I/837P generation; submit via clearinghouse; 835 ERA ingestion; basic 277/999 status.


Patient responsibility, statements, and payment posting.


Reporting


OASIS exports, productivity, visit utilization, missed‑visit trends, revenue by payer.


Compliance dashboards (lock timeliness, order lag, credential expiries).


Definition of Done (Phase 1):
Can run SOC→visits→QA→bill→collect loop for Medicare & at least one Medicaid payer.


OASIS validation passes; EVV events stored; claims accepted by clearinghouse; 835 posting works.



Phase 2 — AI‑Assisted Charting ("Clinician Copilot")
Objective: Accelerate and improve clinical documentation while maintaining strict human control.
Data ingestion & context building


Pull prior episodes, hospital discharge docs, med list, problem list, labs (when available).


Normalize to internal schema; PHI-safe vector index for retrieval.


In‑workflow AI prompts


SOC assistant that asks missing/clarifying questions aligned to OASIS‑E logic.


Autocomplete suggestions for HPI, ROS, objective findings, education given, and care plan goals (SMART) & interventions mapped by diagnosis/risks.


Real‑time consistency checks: vitals vs. narrative; meds vs. diagnosis; risk flags (falls, wounds, insulin).


Care Plan Intelligence


Template library per condition (e.g., CHF, COPD, DM) + tailored intervention suggestions.


Auto‑link education topics, frequency/duration, and measurable outcomes.


Safety & Controls


Clear labeling: “AI suggestion — review & accept.”


Required‑field coverage meter; explain‑why visibility with source citations to prior chart.


Role and scope limits; strict PHI scoping; full audit of AI prompts & accept/reject events.


Definition of Done (Phase 2):
Median SOC documentation time reduced with equal or better QA pass rate; measurable drop in QA revisions.



Phase 3 — Billing Oversight + AI ("Billing Sentinel")
Objective: Reduce denials and speed cash by tying documentation quality directly to billing readiness.
Rules Engine & Scrubbing


Payer‑specific edit rules (coverage, auth, modifiers, frequency caps, EVV rules, diagnosis requirements).


PDGM pre‑flight (HIPPS, LUPA risk), NOA timing watchdog, missing signatures/orders blockers.


Denial Feedback Loop


835 denial reason code ingestion → root‑cause analysis → map to charting recommendations (e.g., add wound measurements, clarify homebound criteria, education documentation).


Auto‑generate correction tasks and message clinic leads.


What‑if Rehearsal


Simulate claim under each payer rule set; surface risks pre‑submission.


KPIs & Alerts


First‑pass clean claim rate, DAR, denial rate, dollars at risk.


Exception feed to QA & clinicians with precise, actionable fixes.


Definition of Done (Phase 3):
Sustained improvement in first‑pass rate; material reduction in avoidable denials linked to documentation gaps.



Phase 4 — Per‑Patient Chatbot ("Chart Chat")
Objective: Natural‑language access to a single patient’s longitudinal record.
Capabilities


Ask questions ("Show last 3 A1c values," "Summarize wound progress," "Any med nonadherence signals?").


Generate structured reports: SOC summary, 30‑day recert note, IDG notes, discharge summary, family update (with consent).


Privacy & Consent


Strict PHI scoping to the selected patient/episode; role‑based redaction; consent workflow for caregiver/family sharing.


Persistent logs of Q&A and report generation in the audit trail.


Safety


No autonomous orders; always requires human verification for any chart‑changing action.


Definition of Done (Phase 4):
Clinicians reliably use Chart Chat to draft summaries that pass QA with minimal edits.



Phase 5 — Volunteer Platform
Objective: Engage volunteers post‑discharge (non‑clinical), stay compliant, and measure impact.
Volunteer Onboarding & Compliance


Applications, background checks, references, HIPAA/PHI training modules, code of conduct.


Role definitions (transportation, social check‑ins, forms assistance like LEAP/Medicaid), boundaries & escalation paths.


Scheduling & Interaction Logging


Assignment by geography/need; messaging; calendar invites.


Log interactions (time, task, notes). Optional geotag for visit verification.


Patient & Data Safety


Strict segregation from clinical chart; volunteers see only minimally necessary info.


Consent capture; auto‑redaction; templated scripts.


Impact & Reporting


Loneliness index, resource connection metrics, readmission reduction correlations.


Definition of Done (Phase 5):
Volunteer activity tracked, compliant, and demonstrably helpful per outcomes dashboard.



Cross‑Cutting Architecture & Platform
Security & Compliance


HIPAA safeguards: encryption at rest/in transit, MFA, RBAC, least‑privilege, detailed audit logs, data retention policies.


BAAs with vendors/clearinghouse; incident response runbook; disaster recovery (RPO/RTO targets).


Interoperability


Clearinghouse integration for X12 (270/271 eligibility, 276/277 claim status, 837I/P, 835 ERA).


HIE/FHIR for summaries; eFax for providers lacking electronic exchange.


Optional e‑prescribe (for NP practice) via certified network.


Data Model (high level)
